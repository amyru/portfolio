    			<p class="ux-payment text-center">With over 68% of carts abandoned, I wanted to design a payment form that instilled trust with a little push for completing the purchase. In my research, trying to promote trust when the customer is just about to enter their card details is the most profitable. In mentioning the payment provider we use and a 100% money back guarantee I hoped to create a trustworthy appearing form.<br><br>According to research consumers are more likely to click on a red button, so this is what I based the color scheme on. I also considered the balance between minimal form fields to fill out and yet gathering enough information consumers feel a payment form needs.</p>
